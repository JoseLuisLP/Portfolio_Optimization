# Portfolio Optimization
This Shinyapp finds out the optimum weights for a selected portfolio based on several constraints. 

### Scope for Improvement
Data can be queried from a database instead of the flat .xlsx file for better performance. Shinyserver doesn't support
any proprietary database driver thus could not bring MS Access database in use.
